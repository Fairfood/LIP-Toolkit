Field preparation consists of three main steps:

The selection of enumerators is crucial and is based on the required data points and the available time for data collection. Based on the survey length and the context (e.g., travel and field conditions), the local project team can decide on the number of interviews to be carried out per day. The formula below is used to calculate the final number of enumerators, with the number of days allocated for data collection and the number of data points per enumerator adjustable as needed.

Enumerators are selected based on the following criteria:

* Background in agriculture   
* Understanding of basic financial concepts, such as profit and loss  
* Fluency in the local language or dialect  
* Familiarity with the geographic area

**Tip: Use a Terms of Reference (ToR) in nearby universities**   
Enumerators who have previously worked with the company are always preferred for their familiarity with the area and local farmers. If new enumerators are needed, good practice is to circulate a Terms of Reference (ToR) to nearby universities with agricultural programmes to ensure the recruitment of knowledgeable candidates. An example of such a ToR can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eo5Zc4ENu8tPu862W0GjrCAI1idEXAIirN7sf_TCGvc/edit?tab=t.0): 

After enumerators are selected, a detailed data collection plan is formulated. This plan specifies which enumerators will visit particular farmers and on which days. The data collection should be done primarily by the project team. Finalising this plan during the kickoff ensures preparedness and coordination.

The following considerations should be considered while designing the data collection plan:

* **Travel time**: Ensure travel time is evenly distributed among enumerators.  
* **Flexibility**: Include extra farmers each day to compensate for potential non-attendance.  
* **Communication**: Farmers should be informed about their interviews at least one day in advance.  
* **Support:** Organise enumerators into groups for mutual support and equip them with field guides to assist in locating farmers.
