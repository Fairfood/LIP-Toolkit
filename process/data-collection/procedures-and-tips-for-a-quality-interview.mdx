This section provides instructions on maximising the chances of obtaining the respondent's cooperation and conducting effective interviews.

**Before any interview**  
Before conducting fieldwork in any community, the field team should contact the local authorities and inform them about the data collection. Even if the list of respondents is available, it is important to notify the local authorities and relevant stakeholders before starting any interviews.

**Obtaining informed consent from respondents**  
It is the responsibility of each enumerator to contact respondents and persuade them to participate in the study. Obtaining respondents' consent can sometimes be challenging, especially in the case the respondents have been pre-identified. The success of the study depends on the ability of enumerators and team leaders to convince selected respondents to participate.

Here are some tips to maximise the chances of obtaining their consent to participate:

* **Dress professionally and always wear your identification badge.** A good presentation is essential to inspire trust in your respondent.  
* **Make the respondent feel comfortable.** Start the interview with a smile and a polite greeting before introducing yourself, rather than jumping straight into the questionnaire.  
* **Obtain verbal informed consent before collecting any data.** A consent text explains the purpose of the study, clarifies that participation is entirely voluntary, ensures that responses are anonymous, and informs respondents that they have the right to refuse to answer any question or stop the interview at any time if they feel uncomfortable.  
* **Maintain a confident and positive approach.** Avoid apologetic phrasing or questions that invite refusal, such as *"Are you too busy?"* Instead, say, *"I’d like to ask you a few questions"* or *"I’d like to speak with you for a few moments."*  
* **Show the official authorisation for data collection if necessary.**  
* **Emphasise anonymity when needed.** If the respondent is hesitant or asks about the purpose of the data, explain that all collected information will remain strictly anonymous, no names will be used, and the final report will anonymise all responses.  
* **Answer all respondent questions honestly.** Before agreeing to an interview, the respondent may have questions about the survey, their selection, or other concerns. Be direct and pleasant in your responses. If they are worried about the interview duration, provide an estimated time without exaggerating, as this might discourage them.  
* **Do not make false promises or offer incentives** to persuade respondents to participate.  
* **If the respondent is unavailable, offer to return at a more convenient time.** Agree on a specific date and time for the interview.  
* **If the respondent refuses outright, politely ask (without insisting) if they are willing to share their reasons for refusal,** as this information needs to be reported.  
* **At the end of the interview, thank the respondent** for their time and participation.

**The consent form**   
Before asking any questions, the interviewer is required to present the contents of the consent form to the respondent. The consent form is structured around the following points:

1. Introduction of the interviewer and their employer. As mentioned earlier, a friendly introduction will help put the respondent at ease and facilitate the interview process  
2. Explanation of the study’s objectives.  
3. Notification of the interview duration.  
4. Presentation of confidentiality protocols.  
5. Information on the voluntary and risk-free nature of participation in the study.  
6. Respondent’s questions.  
7. Useful contacts.

**Behaviour during the interview**

Once the respondent's consent has been obtained, the interview can begin. The following principles must be followed throughout the process:

**Interview the respondent alone:** The presence of another person during the interview may prevent you from obtaining honest responses. Therefore, it is crucial that the interview is conducted in private. If others are present, explain to the respondent that their answers are confidential and that it is necessary to conduct the interview in a setting conducive to one-on-one conversation. In all cases where others are present, make every effort to isolate yourself with the respondent as much as possible. You may, for example, suggest finding a comfortable place to sit in order to answer the questions, which can also serve as a reason to move away from noisy children or other distractions that could disrupt the interview.

**Being neutral during the interview:** Most people are polite and tend to give answers they believe you want to hear. Therefore, it is crucial that you remain completely neutral when asking questions. Never allow your facial expressions or the tone of your voice to make the respondent think they have given the "right" or "wrong" answer. Never appear to approve or disapprove of the respondent's answers.

All questions are carefully formulated to maintain neutrality. They do not suggest that one answer is more likely or preferable than another. If you do not ask the full question, you may compromise this neutrality. You can remind the respondent, if necessary, that there are no right or wrong answers.

If the respondent gives an ambiguous answer, try to probe while maintaining neutrality by asking questions such as:

* “Could you elaborate a bit more?”  
*  “I didn’t quite understand. Could you repeat, please?”  
*  “There is no urgency. Take your time to think it over.”

If the respondent does not understand the question, it is best to first repeat the question exactly as it is formulated in the questionnaire. Often, a simple rereading of the question can resolve the misunderstanding.

Silence can be an important tool for probing the respondent. If a respondent provides an incomplete or inadequate answer, remaining silent for a few seconds after their response often encourages them to elaborate or clarify their answer.

The interviewer must always remain attentive to any difficulties the respondent may encounter, as well as to their emotions and any signs of frustration. For example, if the interviewer notices that the respondent is unsettled for any reason and is no longer in the best condition to answer the questions, it may be helpful to suggest a short break.

**Never suggest answers to the respondent:** If the respondent's answer to a question is not relevant, do not prompt them by saying something like, "*I suppose you mean... don't you?*" In many cases, the respondent will agree with your interpretation of their answer, even if that is not what they actually meant. Instead, you should probe further so that the respondent provides the relevant answers themselves.

**Never change the wording or sequence of the questions:** The wording and sequence of the questions in the questionnaire must be maintained. If the respondent does not understand a question, you should repeat it slowly and clearly. If there are still issues, you can read it again, being careful not to change its original meaning. Only provide the minimum required information to obtain an appropriate answer.

**Do not try to explain the questions:** It is important to standardise the administration of the questionnaire as much as possible by all interviewers. Therefore, it is essential that each interviewer limits themselves to reading each question to the respondent exactly as written. If each interviewer starts explaining the questions, they will end up having different meanings for different surveys, and the responses will be less useful for future analysis. Explain only if the questionnaire instructs you to do so. Otherwise, if a respondent asks what a question means, ask them to answer based on their own understanding.

**Do not attempt to define the words used in the questions:** Unless there are instructions (or definitions) in the questionnaire, leave it to the respondent to interpret each word according to their understanding. Key terms will be explained during training.

**Pace and tone of voice:** If the interviewer reads the questions with a monotonous or hesitant tone, or if the pace of the interview is not appropriate (too fast or too slow), the respondent may lose interest in the questions, become less cooperative, and provide poor-quality information. The interviewer must therefore know how to modulate the pace and tone of their voice depending on the respondent, their reactions, and their attitude.

**Managing hesitant respondents tactfully:** There will be situations where respondents may simply say "I don't know," give an inappropriate answer, appear bored or detached, or contradict something they’ve already said. In these cases, you need to try to re-engage them in the conversation. For example, if you feel they are shy or scared, try to alleviate their shyness or fear before asking the next question. Take some time to talk about things unrelated to the interview (e.g., their neighborhood/village, the rainy season, their daily activities, etc.).

Respondents should not be allowed to go off on tangents or provide unnecessary details for the survey. This is because there is a risk that the later questions will often be rushed. Therefore, time management for the interview is essential. When dealing with very "scattered" and talkative individuals, kindly steer their responses back to the questions asked. Try to bring them back to the core topics while still being attentive.

As an example, if a respondent gives irrelevant or complicated answers, don’t interrupt them abruptly or rudely, but listen to what they have to say. Then, gently guide them back to the original question. A good atmosphere must be maintained throughout the interview.

The best atmosphere for an interview is one where the respondent views the interviewer as a friendly, compassionate, and sensitive person who does not intimidate them and to whom they can say anything without feeling shy or embarrassed. As mentioned earlier, the main issue in gaining the respondent's trust is often discretion. This issue can be prevented if you are able to secure a private location for the interview.

If the respondent is reluctant or unwilling to answer a question, explain once again that the same question is being asked of other household heads (both women and men) in the same environment, and that the responses will be grouped together. If the respondent remains reluctant, simply write "refusal" (or the corresponding code) for that question and proceed as if nothing happened. Remember, the respondent cannot be forced to provide an answer.

**Don’t rush the interview:** Ask questions slowly to ensure that the respondent understands what is being asked. After asking a question, pause and give the respondent time to think. If the respondent feels rushed or is not allowed to formulate their opinion, they may respond with "I don’t know" or give an inaccurate answer.

If you feel the respondent is answering without thinking just to speed up the interview, tell them there is no rush to answer, and their opinion is very important, so they should consider their answers carefully.

That’s why it’s crucial to read the text in the questionnaire word for word, or its closest possible translation, without omitting anything or adding anything. The translations of key terms provided during training should be used. If the person responds before you have finished reading the question, continue reading and then ask them to confirm their answer (especially when listing proposed answers).

Stay focused on your questionnaire and avoid distractions so you don’t waste the respondent’s time or the interview. Stick to the questionnaire’s allotted time.

**Don’t leave a question without an answer:** Unless the respondent clearly says they don’t want to answer, never leave a question with the idea of returning to it later. As mentioned earlier, questions should be asked in the order they appear in the questionnaire, while following the instructions related to skips.

**Takeaway – The good interviewer:** Asks the questions exactly as they are written in the questionnaire, in the same order, ensuring that the respondent feels comfortable and is able to understand and answer.
