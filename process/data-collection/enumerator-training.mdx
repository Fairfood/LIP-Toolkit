Once enumerators are identified, the data collector facilitates a one to two days training (depending on the number of the indicators to collect). The training workshop consists of learning how to use the data collection application on the smartphone (in the case of the farmer survey), understanding the survey, practising interviewing techniques, and learning how to troubleshoot during field data collection. Typically, a training session for the farmer survey data collection includes: 

| Planning | Module | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0.5 day | Mobile data collection | Downloading mobile data collection application Getting to know all the features of the application Calibrating the GPS signal on the phone Battery saving options in the field |
| 0.5-1 day | Understanding the survey | Background and objectives of the project and the data collection Going through the survey question by question Survey best practices and informed consent Simulation in local languages |
| 0.5 day | Practicing (in the field) | Practicing the survey in the field or amongst each other (if the field is too far from the training location). Feedback from the practicing activity |

At the end of the training workshop, the enumerators have group discussions on challenges encountered in the field and have the opportunity to clarify questions about the survey.
