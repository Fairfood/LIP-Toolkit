Various ethical principles are considered during the data collection phase.

**Informed consent and participation**

Data collectors adhere to the principle of 'do no harm.' Every participant is fully informed about how their data will be used and is asked for consent through a specific question built into the survey. This ensures that participation is voluntary and informed.

**Data accessibility and security**

* ***Access control***: Access to survey data is restricted to specific staff members involved in the data collection or analysing the survey. The raw data will be anonymised before doing any analysis and no personal information will be used for analysis.

* ***Non-disclosure***: The raw data is kept confidential and cannot be shared with external stakeholders without a data sharing agreement.

**Data storage and handling**

* ***Cloud storage***: Data is initially stored in its original format on the KoboToolbox server.

* ***Data cleaning and access***:  The data cleaning and access process should take into account your organisationâ€™s internal data practices and policies.
