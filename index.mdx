# **Living Income Price (LIP) Toolkit**

## **How to develop relevant recommendations for Living Income interventions**


## **Introduction to the LIP**
Around the world, sustainability teams are under growing pressure to demonstrate how their supply chains contribute to more equitable livelihoods—not only in *principle*, but in *practice*. Currently being discussed, new regulations such as the [EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)](https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/sustainability-due-diligence-responsible-business/corporate-sustainability-due-diligence_en) and the [EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en) are pushing companies to take more responsibility for what happens at the start of their chains. This means finding concrete ways to support smallholder incomes, improve data quality, and strengthen long-term supply relationships.

The Living Income Price (LIP) Toolkit helps you do just that. Developed by **Fairfood** and **Akvo**, the toolkit is the culmination of a five-year programme funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The programme focused on testing and developing models that promote **fairer value distribution** as a cornerstone of **resilient, inclusive, and consequently more sustainable supply chains**. As a response to that, the LIP Toolkit offers an end-to-end approach for identifying income gaps, designing solutions, and supporting evidence-based decision making across supply chains.

### **A data-first approach**

The LIP Toolkit is built around a two-step strategy to close income gaps and enhance supply chain resilience:

1. **Living Income Price (LIP).** At its core, the toolkit calculates a price floor that covers the real cost of producing a crop—whether **at farmgate, cooperative, and Free-on-Board (FOB) levels**—while still enabling a decent standard of living. By quantifying the gap between current prices and a living income benchmark, you can pinpoint how far the supply chain must move.

2. **Cost-Yield Efficiency (CYE).** Price alone rarely closes the gap, and that’s where the CYE assessment comes in. This analysis classifies farmers by both costs and yields, highlighting who is efficient, who is struggling, and why. This dual lens identifies where cost-saving, productivity, or diversification measures might help—and where pricing interventions are really unavoidable.

Used together, the LIP and CYE methodologies form a two-step strategy: first, to **diagnose** income gaps and how efficiently farmers are operating through rigorous, context-specific data collection and analysis; and second, to (co-)**design** realistic interventions that are grounded in evidence and are shaped with input from different supply chain actors, especially producers.

More than a set of tools, this is a practical approach to support informed decision-making and encourage data-driven investment in agri-food supply chains. Using a bottom-up approach, this toolkit outlines the steps to identify and cost solutions for more equitable value distribution. And because it pulls together several strategies—from improving farm efficiency to adjusting prices—through local and traceable data, it can help companies meet the rising demands of due diligence rules. Most importantly, it equips producer organisations and local partners to participate in the conversation with their own numbers, moving from data providers to actual users. 

As new regulations raise the bar, all producing countries should have a fair shot at meeting these standards. By grounding interventions in verifiable data and openly sharing methodologies and case studies, this approach aims to level the playing field, shift value towards those who grow food, and provide sustainability teams with a clear, defensible story: here is the gap, here is what it costs, and here is the plan to close it—*together*. 

Whether you work in a **corporate sustainability team**, a **producer organisation**, an **NGO**, or a **certification body**, this toolkit is designed to help turn living income ambitions into **actionable, fundable, and implementable strategies**.

# **Introduction to this toolkit** 

### Who this guide is for 

This guide is intended for organisations working in food supply chains, such as producer organisations, export organisation,  NGOs, social enterprises, certification bodies, traders, or corporate sustainability teams, with the ambition of improving the living income of smallholder farmers. **It is particularly suited to users who are involved in impact measurement**, **value** **chain** **development**, or **price-setting initiatives**.

### **What this guide is (and what it is not)** 

This guidance document outlines the methodology and steps required to carry out a Living Income Price (LIP) analysis. It supports users in developing a final slide deck that visualizes the key findings of such an analysis. For each step in the process, we provide practical tools (including Excel templates, R scripts, and best practice documents) to help implement the methodology effectively. This toolkit is the result of a collaboration between Fairfood and Akvo, who have developed this lean version of the LIP analysis approach based on field experience and iteration.

While the guide is highly detailed and comprehensive, it is not a fully automated tool. Users will need to manually complete various activities, make context-specific decisions, and adapt tools where necessary. From scoping to survey implementation to analysis and reporting, a realistic timeline for carrying out the full LIP analysis is approximately two months. This guide is not meant to be a plug-and-play product or a black-box model—it is designed for users who want to understand and be actively involved in each step of the process.

The expected output of using this guide is a visually engaging slide deck that presents the key results of the LIP analysis, such as current versus living income gaps, cost breakdowns, and recommended price adjustments. A dummy version of the final slide deck can be found through [this link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGqCK1v2pc/wToFqfck3VRO03SNq7jH7g/view?utm_content=DAGqCK1v2pc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h5af1444f09). 

### **What’s needed for a successful LIP analysis** 

A successful LIP analysis depends on your ability to collect the required data. In some regions or value chains, farmers may not be used  to tracking or reporting detailed cost and income information, which can affect the accuracy or completeness of your results. If you're not deeply familiar with the context, consider connecting with those who are. Local experts can help determine whether the necessary data can be collected and the correct approach to make farmers comfortable with the process.   Local knowledge will always enhance the credibility and quality of the data. Lastly, it’s worth noting that the current version of the survey builder has been tailored  for the following crops: banana, coffee, cocoa, spices, and shea. Other crops might need tailored questions to account for income correctly. 

### **Minimal skills required to use the toolkit** 

To use this toolkit effectively, users should possess the following baseline skills:

* **Survey and sample design**: Understanding how to frame relevant questions and select a representative sample of respondents is crucial.  
* **Familiarity with indicator frameworks**: Users should understand basic concepts like household income, production costs, and farm profitability.  
* **Basic R skills**: Data cleaning and analysis are performed using R scripts, so users should be able to run scripts, adjust parameters, and troubleshoot errors.  
* **Data analysis literacy**: Users should understand foundational statistical concepts such as averages, medians, and standard deviations.  
* **Excel proficiency**: The survey design tool is Excel-based and will be uploaded to KoboToolbox for data collection.  
* Optional but helpful: comfort using **Canva** and **Flourish** for creating engaging visuals in the final slide deck.

Note that this toolbox is modular. If certain steps fall outside yours or your team’ skillset , it’s always possible to outsource specific parts of the process. Both Akvo Foundation and Fairfood, as they are available for support when desired.
