# üå± Farmer Income Data Toolkit  
*A practical methodology for viable farmer income*  

The **Farmer Income Data Toolkit** is the operational backbone of the **Living Income Commodity Strategy**, developed under the **RECLAIM Sustainability! Programme** and funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  

It translates proven methodologies ‚Äî including **Living Income Price (LIP)** and **Cost‚ÄìYield Efficiency (CYE)** ‚Äî into an open-source, step-by-step resource for anyone working to close the living income gap.  

Co-developed by **Fairfood** and **Akvo**, the toolkit equips sustainability teams, cooperatives, buyers, and farmer organisations to move from **data collection ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí targeted interventions**, ensuring that investments reflect farmer realities. By making these tools public, we aim to **democratise access to replicable, transparent methods** for fair value distribution.
