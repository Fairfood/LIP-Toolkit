Across global agri-food supply chains, sustainability teams face growing pressure to move beyond ambition and demonstrate real impact: How are they supporting equitable livelihoods in practice, not just in principle? New regulations such as the [EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)](https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/sustainability-due-diligence-responsible-business/corporate-sustainability-due-diligence_en) and the [EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en) are pushing companies to take more responsibility for what happens at the start of their chains. This means finding concrete ways to support smallholder incomes, improve data quality, and strengthen long-term supply relationships.

The Actionable Farmer Income Toolkit helps you do just that. This is the first step in a broader, collaborative approach designed by **Fairfood, Heifer International, and Akvo** to enable targeted and contextual action on living incomes: especially in sectors where certification is not widespread and where quality and efficiency performance may lag. This segmentation-based strategy is built for real-world complexity, offering a practical path forward in difficult supply chain settings.

The toolkit is the culmination of a five-year programme funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The programme focused on testing and developing models that promote **fairer value distribution** as a cornerstone of **resilient, inclusive, and consequently more sustainable supply chains**. As a response to that, this Toolkit offers an end-to-end approach for identifying income gaps, designing solutions, and supporting evidence-based decision making across supply chains.

### **A data-led approach to living income action**

At its core, our joint approach combines two complementary methodologies:

1. **Living Income Price (LIP).** Calculates a price floor that enables a decent standard of living for producers, whether at farmgate, cooperative, or Free-on-Board (FOB) level. By comparing current prices with a living income benchmark, it reveals how far the supply chain must move.  
2. **Cost-Yield Efficiency (CYE).** Price alone rarely closes the gap, and thatâ€™s where the CYE assessment comes in. This analysis classifies farmers by both costs and yields, highlighting who is efficient, who is struggling, and why. This dual lens identifies where cost saving, productivity, or diversification measures might help \- and where pricing interventions are really unavoidable.

Used together, these tools allow companies and their partners to identify income gaps with precision, and to design realistic interventions that are grounded in local data and developed in collaboration with producers.

This toolkit guides you through the **first step** of that journey. It helps you calculate a fair and transparent price that supports a living income, and it also lays the groundwork for the next phase. That next phase involves developing practical, data-informed solutions through collective action with local stakeholders.

This is more than a set of tools. It is a practical roadmap for informed decision making and more effective investment in agri-food supply chains. Based on traceable, locally sourced data, the approach outlines the steps in identifying and costing solutions for more equitable value distribution, shifting the conversation from compliance to collaboration. Instead of asking producers to report on data, it enables them to understand and use it.

As new regulations raise the bar, all producing countries should have a fair shot at meeting these standards. By grounding interventions in verifiable data and openly sharing methodologies and case studies, this approach aims to level the playing field, shift value towards those who grow food, and provide sustainability teams with a clear, defensible story: here is the gap, here is what it costs, and here is the plan to close it, *together*. 

Whether you work in a **corporate sustainability team**, a **producer organisation**, an **NGO**, or a **certification body**, this toolkit is designed to help turn living income ambitions into **actionable, fundable, and implementable strategies**.
