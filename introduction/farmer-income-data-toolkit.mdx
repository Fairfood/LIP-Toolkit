The Farmer Income Data Toolkit is the operational backbone of the **Living Income Commodity Strategy**. This technical, open-source toolkit helps you design, collect, analyse, and interpret farmer income data to define a living income price, the income floor farmers need for resilient and sustainable businesses, and ultimately, entire supply chains.

Developed by **Fairfood** and **Akvo**, this methodology is now fully available on GitHub, from survey design to analysis and recommendations, as well as case studies to inspire you while defining the outcomes of your project. We believe practical tools for fairer value distribution should be accessible to all, and this is a step towards more transparent, data-driven, and fair decision-making across value chains.
