A technical, open-source toolkit to help you design, collect, analyse, and interpret farmer income data to define a minimum viable income \- the income floor farmers need for resilient and sustainable supply chains.

Developed by **Fairfood** and **Akvo**, this methodology is now fully available on GitHub \- from survey design to analysis and recommendations \- because practical tools for fairer value chains should be accessible to all. Making the tools public is a step towards more transparent, data-driven, and fair decision-making across value chains.
