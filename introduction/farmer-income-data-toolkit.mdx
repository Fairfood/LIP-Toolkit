The Farmer Income Data Toolkit is the operational backbone of the **Living Income Commodity Strategy,** developed as part of the RECLAIM Sustainability\!. It translates proven methodologies — including Living Income Price (LIP) and Cost–Yield Efficiency (CYE) — into a step-by-step, open-source resource for anyone working to close the living income gap.

Designed by **Fairfood** and **Akvo**  for sustainability teams, cooperatives, buyers, and farmer organisations, it equips users to move from data collection to targeted interventions, ensuring investments are aligned with actual farmer realities. By making the tools public, we aim to democratise access to robust, replicable methods that turn complex data into actionable, transparent solutions for fair value distribution. This toolkit was developed under the RECLAIM Sustainability\! Programme, funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
