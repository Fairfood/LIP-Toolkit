The Living Income Price (LIP) analysis follows a clear three-phase process: **Scoping and preparation**, **Data collection**, and **Analysis and recommendations**. Each phase includes key activities that build toward a robust and context-specific LIP outcome. 

During the **Scoping and preparation** phase, users define the goals, design the survey, and prepare for fieldwork. In the **Data collection** phase, enumerators are trained and fieldwork is conducted with ongoing data quality monitoring. Finally, the **Analysis and recommendations** phase involves cleaning and analysing the data, generating key insights, and visualising results in a final slide deck. This structured process ensures that the LIP analysis is both rigorous and practical, while remaining adaptable to different local contexts.
