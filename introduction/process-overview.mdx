The Living Income Price (LIP) analysis follows a clear three-phase process: **Scoping & Preparation**, **Data Collection**, and **Analysis & Recommendations**. Each phase includes key activities that build toward a robust and context-specific LIP outcome. 

During the **Scoping & Preparation** phase, users define the goals, design the survey, and prepare for fieldwork. In the **Data Collection** phase, enumerators are trained and fieldwork is conducted with ongoing data quality monitoring. Finally, the **Analysis & Recommendations** phase involves cleaning and analysing the data, generating key insights, and visualising results in a final slide deck. This structured process ensures that the LIP analysis is both rigorous and practical, while remaining adaptable to different local contexts.
