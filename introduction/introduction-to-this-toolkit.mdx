### Who this guide is for

This guide is intended for organisations working in food supply chains, such as producer organisations, export organisation,  NGOs, social enterprises, certification bodies, traders, or corporate sustainability teams, with the ambition of improving the living income of smallholder farmers. **It is particularly suited to users who are involved in impact measurement**, **value** **chain** **development**, or **price-setting initiatives**.


### What this guide is and what it is not

This guidance document outlines the methodology and steps required to carry out a Living Income Price (LIP) analysis. It supports users in developing a final slide deck that visualises the key findings of such an analysis. For each step in the process, we provide practical tools (including Excel templates, R scripts, and best practice documents) to help implement the methodology effectively. This toolkit is the result of a collaboration between Fairfood and Akvo, who have developed this lean version of the LIP analysis-approach based on field experience and iteration.

While the guide is highly detailed and comprehensive, it is not a fully automated tool. Users will need to manually complete various activities, make context-specific decisions, and adapt tools where necessary. From scoping to survey implementation, analysis, and reporting, a realistic timeline for carrying out the full LIP analysis is approximately two months. This guide is not meant to be a plug-and-play product or a black-box model \- it is designed for users who want to understand and be actively involved in each step of the process.

The expected output of using this guide is a visually engaging slide deck that presents the key results of the LIP analysis, such as current versus living income gaps, cost breakdowns, and recommended price adjustments. A dummy version of the final slide deck can be found through [this link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGqCK1v2pc/wToFqfck3VRO03SNq7jH7g/view?utm_content=DAGqCK1v2pc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h5af1444f09). 


### Whats needed for a successful LIP analysis

A successful LIP analysis depends on your ability to collect the required data. In some regions or value chains, farmers may not be used to tracking or reporting detailed cost and income information, which can affect the accuracy or completeness of your results. If you're not deeply familiar with the context, consider connecting with those who are. Local experts can help determine whether the necessary data can be collected and the correct approach to make farmers comfortable with the process. Local knowledge will always enhance the credibility and quality of the data. Lastly, it’s worth noting that the current version of the survey builder has been tailored for the following crops: banana, coffee, cocoa, spices, and shea. Other crops might need tailored questions to account for income correctly.


### Minimum skills required to use the toolkit

To use this toolkit effectively, users should possess the following baseline skills:

* **Survey and sample design**: Understanding how to frame relevant questions and select a representative sample of respondents is crucial.  
* **Familiarity with indicator frameworks**: Users should understand basic concepts like household income, production costs, and farm profitability.  
* **Basic R skills**: Data cleaning and analysis are performed using R scripts, so users should be able to run scripts, adjust parameters, and troubleshoot errors.  
* **Data analysis literacy**: Users should understand foundational statistical concepts such as averages, medians, and standard deviations.  
* **Excel proficiency**: The survey design tool is Excel-based and will be uploaded to KoboToolbox for data collection.  
* Optional but helpful: comfort using **Canva** and **Flourish** to create engaging visuals in the final slide deck.

Note that this toolbox is modular. If certain steps fall outside yours or your team’ skillset , it’s always possible to outsource specific parts of the process. Both Akvo and Fairfood are available for support when needed.


### Process Overview

The Living Income Price (LIP) analysis follows a clear three-phase process: **Scoping and preparation**, **Data collection**, and **Analysis and recommendations**. Each phase includes key activities that build toward a robust and context-specific LIP outcome. 

During the **Scoping and preparation** phase, users define the goals, design the survey, and prepare for fieldwork. In the **Data collection** phase, enumerators are trained and fieldwork is conducted with ongoing data quality monitoring. Finally, the **Analysis and recommendations** phase involves cleaning and analysing the data, generating key insights, and visualising results in a final slide deck. This structured process ensures that the LIP analysis is both rigorous and practical, while remaining adaptable to different local contexts.
