A successful LIP analysis depends on your ability to collect the required data. In some regions or value chains, farmers may not be used to tracking or reporting detailed cost and income information, which can affect the accuracy or completeness of your results. If you're not deeply familiar with the context, consider connecting with those who are. Local experts can help determine whether the necessary data can be collected and the correct approach to make farmers comfortable with the process. Local knowledge will always enhance the credibility and quality of the data. Lastly, itâ€™s worth noting that the current version of the survey builder has been tailored for the following crops: banana, coffee, cocoa, spices, and shea. Other crops might need tailored questions to account for income correctly.
