To use this toolkit effectively, users should possess the following baseline skills:

* **Survey and sample design**: Understanding how to frame relevant questions and select a representative sample of respondents is crucial.  
* **Familiarity with indicator frameworks**: Users should understand basic concepts like household income, production costs, and farm profitability.  
* **Basic R skills**: Data cleaning and analysis are performed using R scripts, so users should be able to run scripts, adjust parameters, and troubleshoot errors.  
* **Data analysis literacy**: Users should understand foundational statistical concepts such as averages, medians, and standard deviations.  
* **Excel proficiency**: The survey design tool is Excel-based and will be uploaded to KoboToolbox for data collection.  
* Optional but helpful: comfort using **Canva** and **Flourish** to create engaging visuals in the final slide deck.

Note that this toolbox is modular. If certain steps fall outside yours or your team’ skillset , it’s always possible to outsource specific parts of the process. Both Akvo and Fairfood are available for support when needed.
