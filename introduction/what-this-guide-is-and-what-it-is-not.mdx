This guidance document outlines the methodology and steps required to carry out a Living Income Price (LIP) analysis. It supports users in developing a final slide deck that visualizes the key findings of such an analysis. For each step in the process, we provide practical tools (including Excel templates, R scripts, and best practice documents) to help implement the methodology effectively. This toolkit is the result of a collaboration between Fairfood and Akvo, who have developed this lean version of the LIP analysis approach based on field experience and iteration.

While the guide is highly detailed and comprehensive, it is not a fully automated tool. Users will need to manually complete various activities, make context-specific decisions, and adapt tools where necessary. From scoping to survey implementation to analysis and reporting, a realistic timeline for carrying out the full LIP analysis is approximately two months. This guide is not meant to be a plug-and-play product or a black-box modelâ€”it is designed for users who want to understand and be actively involved in each step of the process.

The expected output of using this guide is a visually engaging slide deck that presents the key results of the LIP analysis, such as current versus living income gaps, cost breakdowns, and recommended price adjustments. A dummy version of the final slide deck can be found through [this link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGqCK1v2pc/wToFqfck3VRO03SNq7jH7g/view?utm_content=DAGqCK1v2pc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h5af1444f09).
